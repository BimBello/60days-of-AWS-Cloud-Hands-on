My AWS Cloud Computing journey

So I have decided to go on a one-man project journey of learning everything I can possibly learn in AWS cloud computing

I'm staring today, 1st of March 2023 and I hope I'm able to complete all the AWS SAA modules by the end of April because I would love to take the certification exam by then.

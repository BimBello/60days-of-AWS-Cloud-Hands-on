# 60days-of-AWS-Cloud-Hands-on
My AWS Cloud Computing journey

SO I have decided to go on a one-man project journey of learning everything I can possibly learn in AWS cloud computing

I'm staring today, 1st of March 2023 and I hope I'm able to complete all the AWS SAA modules by the end of April because I would love to take the certification exam by then.


## Task 1- Creating an AWS free tier account

I opened a new AWS free tier root account using my email and password. Email was verified, credit card details entered,though not charged .I selected a plan (Basic support- free tier account) and voila! I'm signed up..

I went back to the AWS management console and signed in with my email to begin.


## Task 2- Creating Identity and Access Management(IAM) Users and Groups
My root account was used to create another user account that will be used throughout this hands-on. The root account should be "discarded". Users represents people within the organization and they can be placed in groups. 

I created a user and the group because i need to give permissions. These permissions are assigned JSON documents called policies which helps us define the permissions of the user.

## Task 8- Budget Setup

To set up my billing budget on my free tier account so that I can track my spend, I clicked on "My Account", then "Billing Dashbord.  <img width="373" alt="Billing Dashboard" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124819387/222807385-6aeaa31c-76f9-4218-aed7-c1dac72218cb.PNG">

Kindly note that because I'm signed in as IAM user BeemBeem, I did not have the permission to access the billing information. So what did I do?
I signed back in my Root account, from "My account", I scrolled down to find "IAM User and Role Access to Billing information" then i activated IAM Access.

I went back to my IAM user account and refreshed the page to see the AWS Billing dashboard.

To set up my budget, I chose a zero spend budget type, entered my email for notification and thats it! Budget set!<img width="817" alt="Budget_alarm" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/124819387/222822550-f70b9a45-2191-412d-a271-9d720a173176.PNG">
